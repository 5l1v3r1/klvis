# divergence-vis

[KL divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullbackâ€“Leibler_divergence) is an asymmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions. I want a way to visualize KL-divergences between different distributions, in particular so I can compare [char-RNNs](https://github.com/unixpickle/char-rnn). That's what this repository is aimed towards.
